There are two folders in this repository:
1. Fringe Social Media
2. Main Stream Social Media

In the Fringe folder we have all the community guidelines for the five fringe social media platforms, each in its own folders.

In the Mainstream folder, we have all the community guidelines for the nine mainstream social media platforms, each in its folders.

The guidelines versions are on September 15th 2022. The paper is based on the ananalysis of these versions.
